## About the project

  This project was developed during the Next Level Week, an event organized by Rocketseat, whose goal is to, in a week, build a full stack programming application from start to finish. This week the project is called Proffy.

  Proffy is a marketplace application for high school teachers and students. Its goal is to connect students who are seeking help for high school subjects and teachers who are willing to offer them this service. Proffy was developed with a REST API in NodeJS, ReactJS and React Native all using TypeScript.
